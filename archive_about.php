                    <p>If you've never been to a Firkin, why the Firkin not? See, we're not just a bar and we're not just a restaurant. We're an English style pub that serves some of the best Firkin fare in Canada. We do things a little differently around here. All of our dishes and drinks come with a Firkin twist&mdash;except our pints, we leave perfection alone. And all of our restaurant-style pubs are unique. But you'll fit in, everybody does at a Firkin. We're laid back with a wicked sense of humour. Everything a British bar should be.</p>

                    <p style="margin:0 auto;">So what are you waiting for? Great food? Better bevvies? Bits &lsquo;n Bobs? A Firkin restaurant / pub / bar / whatever you want to call us has it all.</p>

                        <p>What's on tap, you ask? The better question is, what isn't! All Firkin Pubs have a wide range of imported and domestic beers to choose from including Kronenbourg and Guinness. You'll also find a selection of premium pale ales, ciders, lagers and pilsners to rival any Firkin wannabee bar or restaurant. After all, we're styled after the traditional English pub&mdash;pints are our specialty.</p>

                        <p>But if you don't fancy a pint, every Firkin has a right ol' drink menu that will tickle your taste buds. From premium reds and whites to tropical thirst quenchers and liquors, we serve it all, if you're of age. In fact, Firkin Pubs feature inspired seasonal specials you won't find at any other bar or restaurant&mdash;summerlicious sippers in the warmer months and blow-the-cold-off-you bevvies in the cooler ones. Firkins are the very definition of a bar. The best bar.</p>

                        <p>Speaking of summer, it's our favourite time of year because Firkin Pubs feature the best patios. Each Firkin Pub has a patio that is just blimey brilliant&mdash;unique, picturesque and close to the bar. The Firkin on Bloor is the biggest Firkin Pub in Canada and boasts a huge rooftop patio like no other. The Churchmouse and Firkin and the Firkin on Harbour were ranked as having two of the <a href="locations">best patios</a> by Toronto's Patio Guide. The Firkin on King features a unique courtyard patio, and the Flatiron and Firkin lets man's best friend chill with their owner on its patio.</p>

                        <p>Our Firkin fare is as unique as each Firkin Pub location. In fact, each Firkin pub-style restaurant features a main Firkin menu, with bloody good food including Crispy Fish Tacos, Beer Brat Spuds, and the Queen's Favourite Firkin Burger, as well as a Daily Specials menu that is as creative as it is delicious.</p>

                        <p>If you're looking for an English pub-style dish you'll go barmy for, our restaurants/bars have that too. Try our Three Little Yorkies (three mini Yorkshire puddings), Ploughman's Lunch or Spuds n' Sauce&mdash;a British take on poutine. Or join us for the <a href="burgers">best brunch</a> in town every Saturday and Sunday until 3 p.m at select locations. Best restaurants in town, right?!?</p>

                        <p>You can also order off of our Bevvy & Bites menu. Every day of the week features a food and drink pairing only the Firkin could dream up. There's Meat & Malt Monday, Nacho Average Tuesday and Wine Not Have Curry Friday to name a few. Check out the entire menu <a href="brews">here</a>.</p>

                        <p>You can thank Chef Dave Godfrey, Firkin's corporate chef, for your Firkin favourites. He's the master chef mastermind behind all of our restaurant's dishes and recipes, including the very creative Daily Specials menu. Chef Dave and his Firkin twisted pub fare are the reasons why Firkins are the best bar-restaurant combos in Canada.</p>

                        <p>Want some free Firkin fare? Who are we kidding, of course you do! Our Firkin Double Decker Bus is on the move with some amazing Firkin food to try. It's the best restaurant on Firkin wheels. Plus, Firkin Pubs are known to treat their patrons from time to time when they stop by for a visit!</p>

                        <p>While each Firkin Pub has something a little different to offer, all of them have one thing in common: great Firkin fun. There is no event like a Firkin event. Our uniquely British bar-style restaurants not only go big during the big events&mdash;Canada Day, New Year's, St. Patty's Day, Halloween, Pride and our own Firkin birthdays&mdash;we celebrate everything! Looking for a place to bring your mum for Mother's Day Brunch? Firkin Pubs have the best brunch in town, including some truly unique fare you won't find at other restaurants: beer brats, beans and eggs and traditional eggs benedict served with Caesars and Mimosas.  Check in with your local Firkin for <a href="locations">Brunch hours</a> and availability.</p>

                        <p>Are you into hockey? Baseball? Footie (because we don't call it soccer, we're British!)? Basketball? There's no better place to watch the game than at a Firkin. Why? Big screens, big cheers, big brews and the <a href="burgers">best burgers</a> of course. We celebrate all of the major sporting events with food and drink specials as well as a few Firkin giveaways.</p>

                        <p>And of course, you can host your own Firkin event. Holiday parties, business meetings, retirement parties; they're all better at a Firkin bar/restaurant. Our relaxed, but cheeky atmosphere is a great place to unwind and show your employees they're the Firkin best. Plus, as one of Ontario's best bars/restaurants, you know we'll have the best beer on-tap and food on the menu.</p>

                    <p>No that's not the name of our new bar, it's a commitment that unites all Firkin Pubs&mdash;to give back to the communities that each Firkin bar/restaurant calls home. For the past 18 years, Firkin Pubs of Canada and all of the Firkin locations have participated in the Annual Firkin Golf Classic in support of causes that truly matter.</p>

                    <p>In 2015, over 280 golfers&mdash;staff, owners, patrons and friends of our bars&mdash;came together at the 18th Annual Firkin Golf Classic to raise money for <a href="https://drjaychildrensgriefcentre.ca/" target="_blank">The Dr. Jay Children's Grief Program</a>. Over the next four years, we plan to raise over one million dollars for this amazing foundation that supports children who have a terminal illness or who are experiencing the death of a family member.</p>

                    <p>We're also proud supporters of:</p>
