                        <p>Tuesday may arguably be the most lackluster day of the week - it's not quite in the middle, barely at the beginning, and it's far from the weekend. At Firkin, we'll give you something to look forward to this Tuesday.</p>

Swap it out for a spicy chicken taco for no extra charge.</p>

                        <p>...Or maybe we should say "put a bunch of wings on it".</p>

                        <p>Drop in on Wednesday to try the sauciest, meatiest wings in the neighbourhood for an impressive $10 per pound. Get them tossed in your choice of medium, hot, Cajun, honey garlic, sweet chili, or 40 Creek BBQ sauce. If you're feeling a little bit dangerous, we dare you to soak your wings in our fiery Ghost Pepper suicide sauce. If you go for it, you'll need a frosty pint to cool you down.

                        <p>It was a long week - and you have an appetite that won't quit. As always, Firkin serves up the best British pub food in affordable and decadent daily features.</p>

                        <p>At this point, you must understand how our new "happy hour" formula works. Our alternative to the now outdated happy hour is low prices and high quality all day long. So, what kind of refreshing beverage awaits you this Saturday at Firkin?</p>

                        <p>This Saturday, grab yourself one of our $5 20 oz. pint features! Now on Saturdays, you have two new options! Feeling something on the dark side? Perhaps you'll find yourself choosing a 20oz pint of Rickard's Red, Rickard's Irish-style ale, has a full-bodied flavour and notes of malt and caramel.</p>

                        <p>Or perhaps you're looking for something on the citrusy side? We have introduced Belgian Moon&trade; to our draught line up! This delicious Belgian-Style wheat beer is brewed with malted barley, wheat and rolled oats. Coriander, along with Valencia and navel orange peels are added to create a unique and refreshing, unfiltered beer. Each brew is served on-tap and perfectly chilled.</p>

                        <p>The <a href="brews">best drink special</a> comes complete with a bite to eat. We serve up the best British pub fare, nachos, for just another $7. Our Skillet Nachos are fully loaded, smothered with cheese, and accompanied by sour cream and tomato salsa.</p>

                        <p>Try a 20 oz. pint of Moosehead Lager or Samuel Adams!</p>

                        <p>Moosehead is Canada's oldest independent brewery. Moosehead was established in 1867, the very year our country was born, and there's a good reason why it has stuck around for so long. Moosehead's golden lager has light body and is highly refreshing, making it the perfect brew for a lazy Sunday afternoon.</p>

                        <p>Sam Adams Boston Lager helped lead the American beer revolution, reviving a passion for full-bodied brews that are robust and rich with character. Since 1984, Samuel Adams Boston Lager has used only the finest hand-selected ingredients to create this perfectly balanced, complex and full-bodied original brew.</p>

                        <p>Pair your pint with our signature Mac N'Cheese for only $7. Our Mac N'Cheese features perfectly cooked macaroni in a creamy 4 cheese sauce topped with brown butter breadcrumbs.</p>
