                    <p class="right-text">Nothing says summer like enjoying a juicy burger on the deck, or in the case of a Firkin Pub, it's a juicy burger on the <a href="locations">patio</a> with a refreshing summer sipper in your hand. Whether you are at a Firkin in downtown Toronto, Pickering, Newmarket or Cambridge, burgers are on the menu. From the "Queen's Favourite" Firkin Burger topped with melted Monterey Jack, bacon and oh-so-different beer braised onions to a Black Bean Veggie Burger with fresh guac and pico de gallo, there is a burger for everyone at a Firkin pub-style restaurant.</p>

                    <p class="right-text">If you haven't heard of The Firkin Group of Pubs before now, they are just that - a group of authentic British style pubs found all across Ontario and into the United States. While each location offers its own distinct take on the British pub experience, each restaurant offers incredibly delicious and original burgers. It's all part of Chef Dave Godfrey's best-burgers-in-town plan.</p>

                    <p class="right-text">Back in 2011, Chef Dave came aboard as Firkin's corporate chef and he's been dedicated to redefining Firkin Pub fare ever since. Wanting to keep to the pub/restaurant chain's authentic British feel, Chef Dave kept his focus on traditional pub food, but added a Firkin twist to each starter and entr&eacute;e. He's created new dishes that can be found in every pub, including the Firkin take on the traditional burger and fries.</p>

                    <img src="img/burgers-content/burgers-fries.jpg" alt="Firkin Buffalo Chicken with Fries and Beer" class="firkin-img-left">

                    <p class="left-text">Every Firkin hamburger is made just the way the patron likes them. It all begins with a fresh, never frozen 100% ground chuck burger. The rest is up to you. All burgers come garnished with crisp lettuce, zesty tomato, fresh onion, must-have pickle and the Firkin's very own tangy burger sauce. But that's where the similarities end. Each feature burger - The Firkin Burger, Turkey Burger, Black Bean Veggie Burger and Old Fashioned - are served with their own mouth-watering toppings. And if that weren't enough, burger lovers can add a number of unique toppings to their burger of choice: avocado, deep fried dill pickles, bacon, saut&eacute;ed mushrooms, jalapenos, fried egg, beer braised onions, roasted red peppers and a variety of cheese, including blue cheese. Not only is every burger served with a side of golden fries, a pile of crispy onion rings is stacked atop each perfectly toasted bun. Never again will you have to choose between fries and rings, at least not at a Firkin pub. It's just one more reason Firkin burgers are the best burgers.</p>

                    <p class="left-text">All Firkin Pubs cater to a number of tastes, including vegetarian, non-red meateaters, and those looking to cut down on the carbs. If you want your burger bun-less, you can have your burger bun-less. If your tastes tend to gravitate towards apps and mini-munchies, these pub-style restaurants have you covered. The Firkin's Cheddar and Bacon Sliders are part of the Starters menu and feature a trio of fit-in-the-palm-of-your-hand beef burgers brushed with delightfully delicious Dijon mayonnaise. These mini marvels are perfect for kids, a quick snack or a late night nosh.</p>

                    <p class="right-text">Firkin Pubs also feature food specials that are unique to each restaurant.  And burgers are almost always on the menu. Every Monday, at every Firkin Pub, you can get a great Firkin deal on an Old Fashioned burger and fries. Many other Firkin Pubs update their Daily Specials menu every day on their websites under Specials-Food. And if you're really Firkin lucky, you may even score some free fare. Firkin Pubs are known to give patrons a free taste of their new and most favourite menu items. Most recently, the Firkin Double Decker Bus travelled to Firkins in the GTA giving away samples of their Cheddar and Bacon Slider Burgers.</p>

                    <p class="right-text">You can find out everything you need to know about where to go for free fare and other events by visiting and liking the Firkin Group of Pubs Corporate <a href="https://www.facebook.com/firkinpubs" target="_blank">Facebook</a> page.

                    <p class="left-text">Of course Firkin burgers would not be complete without a Firkin brew, or other adult beverage. In fact, the Firkin's new Bevvy &amp; Bites menu is dedicated to serving up the perfect food-drink combination at a fair Firkin price. Up first is the Meat &amp; Malt Monday combo, offering patrons a pint of Butler's and a Firkin burger. In time for the heat, the pubs are offering a lineup of summerlicious drink specials including Sparkling Negroni, Watermelon Crush, Red Sangria, Bourbon &amp; Brickworks, Pimm's O'Clock and Blueberry Brixton. But there's more than just burgers, beer and bevvies at the Firkin.</p>

                    <p class="left-text">Restaurant goers, especially in the downtown core, are always looking for a place for Sunday brunch. The Firkin Brunch is just as popular as their burgers and features some truly authentic British breakfast fare. Only at the Firkin can you get Breakfast Spuds, Beer Brats, Beans and Eggs as well as traditional Eggs Benedict served with a Caesar or Mimosa. Brunch is served every Saturday and Sunday until 3 p.m. at select locations! With the best burger and brunch all in a truly unique setting, the Firkin has a lot to brag about.</p>

                    <p class="left-text">If you're looking for a bar-restaurant combo that's a little different, the Firkin has it all - the best burgers, beer, bevvies and brunch an English style pub has to offer. The Firkin is everything you want in a pub - unpretentious, laid back fun with a side order of suburb food and drink. Whether you want to watch the game, bring a date or hang out on the patio, you're always welcome at the Firkin. And with over 30 pub locations in Ontario alone, there's always a Firkin, and a Firkin awesome burger, just around the corner.</p>
