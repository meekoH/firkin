                            <p>Toronto's favourite British pub for patio season, Firkin features spacious street level or rooftop seating at many of our prime locations. Join us any day of the week for a daily special, or choose from our extensive menu of traditional pub cuisine and new fresh classics. Enjoy a lazy weekend brunch, or cap off the day with a frosty regional brew on the patio. Rediscover Firkin at our modern New Britannia venues, or keep it classic at our authentic Traditional public houses. Experience the new breed of British pubs, even when you're on the road: find your patio and our familiar hospitality en route at our friendly outposts in the GTA, Kitchener-Waterloo, Ottawa and the U.S.</p>

                            <p>Atmosphere? We've got plenty. Attitude? Indubitably. The setting? That's up to you. Our traditionally styled British pubs set the standard without being stuffy, while our New Britannia locations are inspired by a more contemporary U.K. vibe. Many of both offer the best rooftops and patios for midsummer days (and nights). Either way, we congratulate you on your excellent taste! Speaking of which, you don't need to take our word for it that we may just offer the <a href="burgers">best brunch</a> menu and finest beer battered fish and chips to be found on any patio this side of the Atlantic.</p>

                            <p>The skies are friendly: select Firkin locations offer rooftop patios for a more elevated urban oasis. The result? The best patio aerie for breathtaking city views, always a perfect pairing for our great brunch options and tempting traditional British fare.</p>
